USER LIST
DEMO

DESCRIPTION
1) Created a generic function to fetch data from a given endpoint URL and a specific function to fetch users.

2) Used AsyncThunk to fetch user data from the API.

3) Used createSlice with an initial state containing: an initial array, a filtered array, query, a loading status, and an error status.

4) Created reducers to filter the initial array.

5) Handled asynchronous actions with extra reducers, managing fulfilled, pending, and rejected states.

6) Retrieved the filtered array and information about loading and error statuses in the main file. Used this data to display an error message, a loading component, or a list.
